                Write, WriteLine :The most common method to output something in C# is WriteLine() and Write().
                            The difference is that WriteLine() prints the output on a new line each time, while Write() prints on the same line
                Convert : this is used to convert one data type to other data type
                ReadLine : it is a input statement to take values
                ToByte : it is used to conver data into bytes */

                  A main method is static since it is available to run when the C# program starts. It is the entry point of the program and runs without even creating an instance of the class.*/
